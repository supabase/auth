  title: Supabase Auth REST API
  description: |-
    This is the REST API for [Supabase Auth](https://supabase.com/auth). Visit https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth for complete documentation.

    **Notes:**
    - HTTP 5XX errors are not listed for each endpoint.
      These should be handled globally. Not all HTTP 5XX errors are generated from Auth, and they may serve non-JSON content. Make sure you inspect the `Content-Type` header before parsing as JSON.
    - Error responses are somewhat inconsistent.
      Avoid using the `msg` and HTTP status code to identify errors. HTTP 400 and 422 are used interchangeably in many APIs.
    - If the server has CAPTCHA protection enabled, the verification token should be included in the request body.
    - Rate limit errors are consistently raised with the HTTP 429 code.
    - Enums are used only in request bodies / parameters and not in responses to ensure wide compatibility with code generators that fail to include an unknown enum case.

    **Backward compatibility:**
    - Endpoints marked as _Experimental_ may change without notice.
    - Endpoints marked as _Deprecated_ will be supported for at least 3 months since being marked as deprecated.
    - HTTP status codes like 400, 404, 422 may change for the same underlying error condition.

            - What grant type should be used to issue an access and refresh token. Note: `id_token` is only offered in experimental mode. 

            - CAPTCHA protection does not apply on the `refresh_token` grant flow.

            - Using `password` is akin to a user signing in. 

            - `pkce` is used for exchanging the authorization code for a pair of access and refresh tokens.
